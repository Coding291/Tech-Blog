# Tech-Blog

This week's challenge involves developing a CMS-style blog site resembling Wordpress, tailored for developers to publish their blog posts and engage in commenting on others' contributions. The primary goal is to construct this site from scratch and deploy it on Heroku, adhering to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. Leveraging technologies such as Handlebars.js for templating and Sequelize for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), alongside the express-session npm package for authentication, ensures a robust and scalable architecture.

Upon visiting the site, users are greeted with the homepage displaying existing blog posts and navigation links for the homepage and dashboard, along with the option to log in. Signing up prompts users to create a username and password, subsequently logging them into the site. Subsequent visits grant access to signed-in users, offering navigation links for homepage, dashboard, and logout options. Within the dashboard, users can create new posts, manage existing ones, and logout securely. These features, coupled with stringent authentication protocols, ensure a seamless and secure user experience on the CMS-style blog site.
